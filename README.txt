-Purpose:
  TO Implement a parser that processes sequences of correctly paired ifs and elses in a
  C++ program. There may be ifs without elses, but not elses without ifs. ifâ€™s may appear
  within blocks and your parser must correctly pair them with an else(s) if any

-program file name:
 "gonza_parser.C"

-Programming Language:
 C++

-Purpose Of Program:

------HOW TO COMPILE-------
g++ -o gonza_parser  gonza_parser.C

-------HOW TO RUN-------
./gonza_parser

*sequence.txt should contain sequences used by this program to check if correct or incorrect*


Output:
-Out Puts will display PDA results regarding our sequences
-it should display the total number of sequences in our file followed by its result
